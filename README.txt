This is a skeleton environment built using an Express server and React front-ent.
There is some basic middleware for development QoL, as well as some basic security stuff.
View package.json in both the client and server directory to see what modules are installed.

TO INSTALL:
1. CD into the server directory
2. Type npm install
3. CD into the client directory 
4. Type npm install 

TO RUN:
1. Be in the server directory.
2. In the terminal, type: "npm run start" (note, this will run both the Express server AND the React client through concurrently)
3. By default, access http://localhost:3000 in your browser to see Hello World
4. Have fun :D
